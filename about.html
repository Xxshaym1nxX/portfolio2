	<p>According to family lore, when she was less than a year old, her father and sister were playing in the deep end of the pool. 
		She was sitting on the steps but wanted to be with them, so she put her head down and paddled over. No one had taught her, she just did it. 
		That has been her modus operandi ever since.</p>
	<p>Being mildly autistic, she was slow to develop speech, so to communicate she would draw. She spent hours standing at the chalkboard, drawing, erasing, then drawing again.
		Later, using markers on paper, she would finish one drawing straight after another. It should come as no surprise that when she learned to create digital art, 
		she would pursue it with the same dogged dedication and confidence – learning by doing.</p>
	<p>In grade school, she would create crude video animatics. Years later, having discovered digital art speedpaint videos, she learned to reproduce anything that caught her eye.
		That led her to pursue a degree in Graphic Design at Seminole State College, and now Game Design at the University of Central Florida.</p> 
	<p>She has spent thousands of hours creating digital art and building her portfolio. She has learned how to compose an illustration utilizing perspective, color theory, 
		conveying emotion in each character’s face, eyes, and body, so as to tell their stories.</p>
	<p>She is skilled in all the Adobe Suite apps, as well as Maya and ZBrush. She excels in vectorized art, raster illustration, photomanipulation, compositing, 
		formatting and animation, as well as video creation and editing. She has published a book of short stories using her own illustrated cover art.</p>
